## Features ##

This is a plugin designed for hardcore-style servers, where players are temporarily banned upon death. You can grant players revival credits, which allow them to join the server before their ban time is up.

<tr><td>Enabled</td>
<td>Boolean value to determine whether the plugin is enabled or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ban-Time</td>
<td>Default time a player should be banned in the format of #y#mo#w#d#h#m#s, replacing # with the number of years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively, to be banned. A value does not have to be specified for each time unit (i.e., 1h30m is still valid).</td></tr>

<tr><td>Early-Message</td>
<td>String value shown to a player when trying to log in to the server while still banned.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Starting-Credits</td>

<tr><td>Verbose</td>
